# Python Final Project

## Introduction

The recent election inspired me to take a closer look at election data. I realized that I'm relatively unfamiliar with the patterns and trends in election data for the House of Representatives. I wanted to take a look at how election patterns changed over time and what districts have shown the most change.



## Libraries
The following libraries were used: Pandas and Seaborn



## Data Source
MIT and Harvard provide a wide variety of election data sources which can be accessed here: https://electionlab.mit.edu/data. The House of Representatives election data source that was used contained data between 1976 and 2018 and can be accessed here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IG0UN2.
